Merge Sort: 
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(n)
Θ(nlgn)

Wiggle Sort 1: 
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + 2Θ(n)
Θ(nlgn)

Max Heap: 
O(n)

Wiggle Sort 2: 
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(1) + O(n)
O(n)

Therefore, the second wiggle sort algorithm, based on a max heap, is more time-efficient than the first algorithm.
[O(n) is better than Θ(nlgn)]
